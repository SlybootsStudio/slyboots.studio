## Mission

Slyboots Studio wants to disrupt the current trend in game design and development focused around manipulative and unethical practices relating to monetary gain.

Our mission is to design, develop, and publish games that are free of microtransactions, ads, and gambling (loot boxes). We want to create immersive worlds where players can have fun and explore without their experiences being interrupted or limited by their wallets.

We are a crowdfunded studio aiming to provides games for players looking for fun, open source projects for aspiring game designers, and coding lessons for eager developers.

## Games

### Raccooth

#### Racooons. Dragons. Trash

*A trash-fueled adventure of wild high jinx and epic combat.*


>Welcome to a world where humans, elves, and dwarves live in harmony and have had no need to developed weapons or researched the arcane arts. Outside of their tranquil kingdoms loom a dangerous and wonderous world that await you, the vermin of the kingdoms' trashpiles.
